    <h1>Peach Cake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I can tell you this amazing yeast-based Baltimore peach cake is easy to make — even though I’ve never been to Baltimore and can’t comment on the current state of affairs there. It’s said that German immigrants, who apparently brought this recipe to Baltimore, used to top it with sweet caramelized onions. I don’t know about onions, but any ripe, sweet fruit should work in this. Serve with ice cream if desired.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm milk (no hotter than 100 degrees F (38 degrees C))</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Combine sugar and yeast in a bowl. Pour in milk, melted butter, and egg; whisk together until sugar is dissolved. Stir in flour, a small amount at a time, until mostly moistened, adding more if the dough is too wet. Add salt and stir until a soft, slightly sticky dough comes together. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Start the topping: Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Split peaches in half along the seam and slice halves into quarters, then into eighths.

        </li>
        <li>Transfer dough to the prepared baking dish. Use a spatula to spread dough out to the corners of the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise once more until roughly doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange peach slices over dough, pressing them in lightly. Drizzle with 2 1/2 tablespoons melted butter, then sprinkle with Demerara sugar.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into cake (not through a peach) comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine apricot preserves and hot water in a small bowl and mix until preserves are heated and brushable; brush glaze over cake. Let cool to room temperature before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
