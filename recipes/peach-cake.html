    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I can tell you this amazing yeast-based Baltimore peach cake is easy to make — even though I’ve never been to Baltimore and can’t comment on the current state of affairs there. It’s said that German immigrants, who apparently brought this recipe to Baltimore, used to top it with sweet caramelized onions. I don’t know about onions, but any ripe, sweet fruit should work in this. Serve with ice cream if desired.</p>
